    <h2>My Major</h2>
    <p>I am majoring in computer science.</p>
    <p>
        Computer Science is the study of computation, including its principles and foundations, its efficient implementation, its analysis, and its practical use in a wide range of different application areas. Computer Science is far more than just programming and no other science or engineering discipline has had a greater impact in such diverse areas as commerce, communication, entertainment, finance, medicine, the social sciences, the physical sciences and the life sciences. Computer Science impacts our daily lives in a multitude of ways and computer scientists are instrumental in driving these changes. Computer Science transforms the way we look at and live in our world.
